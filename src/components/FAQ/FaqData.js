      question: 'Has the Smart Contract a security audit?',
      answer: 'Yes, your tokens that you have bought in the Private Community Sale or in the Presale are vested in order to prevent pump & dump after the Public Listing. Immediately after the Public Sale, you can claim your tokens that you secured in the Private Community Sale in your Vesting Dashboard. The vesting period for the Private Sale community investors is 17 months, of which you can claim approx. 6% per month from the 31st day after the Public Sale. The TGE Presale Event is also subject to vesting: 20% of your $WSI can be claimed immediately after the Public Listing on your Vesting Dashboard and the remaining 80% will be paid out at 6.6% per month over a period of 12 months. Please note that your tokens will be displayed in the Vesting Dashboard. When you claim them, the $WSI tokens will be transferred to your Metamask or Trustwallet. Please make sure you have added the token address in Metamask to see your $WSI tokens after claiming. WSI token address: 0x837A130aED114300Bab4f9f1F4f500682f7efd48',

        answer: ' You can claim your $WSI taking into account the vesting strategy via your dashboard on https://app.https://www.swimspreadwisdom.io//vesting. Because you have to pay gas fees on each claim, we do not recommend doing this multiple times a day.',

        question: 'What should I do with my claimed $WSI tokens?',
        answer: 'No financial advice: You can either sell them directly or stake the tokens and multiply them. Immediately after the public launch, we start our staking programme with an attractive annual return of up to 200% APY. 8% of the total supply is reserved for the community. Furthermore, as a token holder you will benefit from the airdrop, which will be announced after the public sale and distributed to token holders. You have to decide for yourself whether you want to invest in the project for the short or long term.'
